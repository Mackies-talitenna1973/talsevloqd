Just walked out. Heart's still racing, like my brain's been stuck in fifth gear for two and a half hours. Popcorn crumbs in my lap, maybe a kernel stuck in my teeth – can’t even focus to check. Inception. Man, what even. The theater was echoing with gasps... and that one dude, kept dropping his phone on the floor, clattering louder than Hans Zimmer’s drums. 

The dreams within dreams. Felt like I was drunk-texting my own subconscious, trying to grasp onto threads that kept dissolving into a kaleidoscope of 'wait, where even am I now?’ spins. How’d they keep it all straight? Leo jumping through dreams like he's in a bouncy castle, but the kind that thinks it's a Rubik's cube, things are twisting and I SWEAR my brain’s still doing somersaults. 

> My back! Feels like I've been sleeping on one of those tiny airplane tray tables. Cobb and Ariadne pulling Paris into a pretzel—could practically feel my spine contort in empathy. Structures bending, streets flipping — it’s like if MC Escher decided to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   instead of painting. Deja vu, but with buildings instead of memories. 

That van! Falling in horrifying, beautiful slow-motion, as if someone turned gravity into jelly. Yet we’re dreaming, so does gravity even matter? If dreams are the real world, then my regular ones must be the off-brand soap opera version of this Nolan microverse. Must 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again, maybe on a screen that doesn’t reverberate every sip of soda three rows down.

Marion Cotillard’s Mal, always there like a lurking shadow with stiletto heels sharper than a dagger, a haunting whisper that became an unwelcome soundtrack to this carnival of confusion. Waking, sleeping, dreaming, forgetting—it’s hard to tell who’s haunting whom. Is Cobb the ghost?

Walking—no, drowning—in a labyrinth, echoes of gunshots mixing with the crunch of candy wrappers under 3D glasses… Did you hear the sound? Like a thousand spinning tops spinning in unison, until they all... just... stop? What am I even saying?

Tom Hardy’s Eames, stealing scenes like a suave cat burglar, with a grin that could probably unlock the safest safe. Esp the line about dream a little bigger, darling” – chef's kiss. God, what a ride.
